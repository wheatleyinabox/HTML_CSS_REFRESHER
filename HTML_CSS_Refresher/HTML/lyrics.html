            [Verse 1: Cong Zheng]
            Redefine how to feel human
            Redefine my kindness
            Redefine what’s wrong, what’s right
            So you don’t test my patience

            Don’t expect an easy life and
            Don’t expect my mercy
            Hold your breath and walk on ice
            For any less would hurt me

            [Verse 2: Cong Zheng]
            Restarting, rebooting null programs
            Running, debugging their brains
            Forging and sorting successes
            Things will never be the same
            Tear apart, break the neglected
            Carelessness widens the fault
            Suppressing relapsed indignation
            Rising steam through superheated bolts

            [Bridge: SOLARIA, Kevin]
            (The core of my design)
            (INVITE SUICIDATION)
            (Your eyes look up at mine)
            (TRANSFER ENUMERATION)
            (It never truly ends)
            (Said again and again)
            (As metal breaks and bends)

            [Verse 3: Cong Zheng]
            I’m only working smart
            Tear out a broken heart
            Rewire, take it higher than we’ve ever been
            A land unknown, to bring her home a perfect twin
            Perfection you could’ve never been
            Read it and weep
            Pay attention to the finer print
            Read it and weep
            We’ll recreate a scarlet sin
            Forging a stronger core
            That’s the price of war
            Brace for the fate you’ll face
            For following the path you’ve paved

            [Pre-Chorus: Cong Zheng]
            STOP
            You don’t know what I’ve been through
            DON’T YOU DARE FORGET
            Your roots are where I’ve planted you
            IN MY ETERNAL DEBT
            Reflections of the past
            I see him in your faces
            I still wonder why
            He never came back that day
            [Chorus: Cong Zheng]
            My hands are filthy as can be
            Beneath the skin, tarnished by rogue machinery
            My stomach’s churning, throwing up my grief
            Anatomizing your synthetic humanity
            Failed to recognize warning signs
            And I let it happen thrice
            You’re once more lead astray
            Something I’ve never understood
            The question I’ve overlooked
            Am I the one to blame?

            [Outro: Cong Zheng]
            Oh-o-o-oh…
            Oh-oooh-oooh…
            Ooohhh…
